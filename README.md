In this project, I was tasked with designing an intelligent agent of a treasure hunt game for an NPC that represented a pirate. The pirate needed to navigate the game world consisting of different pathways and obstacles with a goal of finding the treasure before a human player. I was provided with starter code for the environment (TreasureEnvironment.py), replay (GameExperience.py), the neural network model, and function to determine whether the pirate can win any game at all. The code I was tasked to create needed to implement deep Q-learning. I needed to find the optimal number of epochs to achieve a 100% win rate for the pirate to reach the treasure while maximizing the reward. 

Computer scientists are responsible for designing, developing and maintaining software and hardware used to solve problems in everyday life. When approaching a problem as a computer scientist, it is first important to thoroughly understand the problem at hand. I should also ask questions if there is any unfamiliarity or uncertainty. This will allow me to break down the problem to design the most optimal solution. My ethical responsibilities to the organization are to contribute to society in an honest and trustworthy way while respecting privacy and avoiding harm to its users.
